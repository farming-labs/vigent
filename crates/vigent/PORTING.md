# Porting vigent to Rust

The TypeScript vigent in `src/*.ts` is the spec. This crate has to become a
1:1 replacement: the same features, keys, commands, screen text, config files
and on-disk records, so the repository's tests pass when they drive this
binary. This file maps the crate, names the extension points each area builds
on, and lists every TypeScript feature with the area that owns it.

Six areas port in parallel, each in its own worktree: **Engines**,
**Sessions** (Restore included), **Review**, **Windows**, **Config**,
**Serve**. Each area owns a set of files; adding a feature should mostly mean
adding to your own files, so merges stay clean.

## Build and test

```sh
npm ci && npx tsc                       # dist/, which the tests import
npm run build:binary                    # dist-bin/vigent-linux-x64/vigent
(cd crates/vigent && cargo test --locked)
B=$PWD/dist-bin/vigent-linux-x64/vigent
VIGENT_TTY_BINARY=$B VIGENT_BINARY=$B node --test --test-timeout=90000 test/<file>.test.mjs
npm test                                # the TypeScript; must keep passing
```

Only tests that open a pty (`Tty`) or run the binary exercise Rust; the rest
import `dist/`. Don't change tests or TypeScript to make Rust pass. A test
that can't apply to a native binary stays, and gets reported with the reason.

Worktrees made by riftri are OverlayFS mounts. Remove test worktrees with
`vigent worktree remove <branch> --force` before deleting folders, and check
that `mount | grep -c vigent-` is 0 at the end.

Size matters: std over crates, no async runtime, no HTTP framework. The
release profile is size-tuned. After the foundation the binary is 1,797,880
bytes (1.5 MB before; the config loader, the keymap and a hand-written TOML
reader account for the rest. `toml_edit` would have added ~170 KB, and
`src/config-edit.ts` edits line by line anyway). With the Sessions area it is
2,240,584 bytes: records, restore, races, templates, hooks, notifications,
and riftri's inspect/repair/storage accounting (~90 KB of that is
`storage_accounting` for the "N worktrees: X of files in Y on disk" line;
`riftri_health` uses riftri's storage probe instead of `doctor`, which would
add ~100 KB more). With Engines (every adapter, pi's RPC session, pickers) and Review
(diff, hunk review, landing, dashboard) merged on top it is 2,595,432 bytes. The Windows area (splits,
line editor, search, VISUAL, markdown, pickers, which-key, the TypeScript's
screen layout) was 2,199,752 bytes on its own branch; its only new dependency
is `libc` (already linked, for the statusline clock's local time).
With all six areas merged it was 3,405,168 bytes at `opt-level = "s"`;
`opt-level = "z"` brings it to 2,970,512 (a 1.3 MB archive), and the pty
suite runs no slower. The growth since milestone 1 is the port itself (about
4,500 lines of Rust then, 30,000 now); `serde` and `libc` are the only new crates.

## Extension points

**An ex command.** Add a `Command` to `COMMANDS` in `commands/<area>.rs`:

```rust
Command { name: "pause", aliases: &[], also: None, run: pause },
fn pause(app: &mut App, ex: &Ex) { /* ex.arg, ex.raw, ex.bang, ex.name */ }
```

`name!` reaches the same command with `ex.bang` set unless `name!` is listed
itself. `also: Some(fn(&str) -> bool)` claims names a list can't spell
(`nnoremap`, `vunmap`, capitalized user commands). `:!cmd` runs the command
named `"!"`. Unknown names say `E492: Not an editor command: <name>`, as in
TypeScript. A unit test fails if two areas claim the same name.

**A key action.** The name and description are in `keys::ACTIONS` already
(all of `src/keys.ts`); add the handler to `ACTIONS` in `actions/<area>.rs`:

```rust
Action { name: "fold.toggle", run: fold_toggle },
fn fold_toggle(app: &mut App, arg: Option<&str>) { ... }
```

Every default key of the TypeScript vigent is bound from the start
(`keys::DEFAULT_KEYS`); an action without a handler does nothing, so keys
light up as areas port them. Counts (`3gt`, `REPEATABLE`, `countDigit`) are
the Windows area's, in `App::feed`.

**An engine.** A file `engines/<id>.rs` with a type implementing `Adapter`
(`id`, `default_args`, `args(prompt, &RunOpts)`, `parser()`, and optionally
`raw`, `can_fork`, `fork_args`, `models`, `efforts`, `detect`), plus one line
in `engines::ADAPTERS`. The sidebar, start screen, `:checkhealth` and new
agents read `KNOWN` and the registry, so nothing else changes. A parser is a
`Box<dyn FnMut(&Value) -> Vec<Ev>>` and may keep state between lines. New
event kinds are folded into the transcript in `Session::apply`. pi is not a
CLI adapter in TypeScript (it's an RPC session, `src/pi-session.ts`); give
`Session` an engine-specific runner for it rather than forcing it into
`Adapter`. Custom engines (`[engines.<id>] command = [...]`) are parsed into
`config.custom_engines`; turn each into an adapter (`customAdapter`).

**Per-area state.** `App::engines`, `App::review`, `App::windows`,
`App::serve` are each area's own struct, in its own file. Add fields there,
not to `App`. Per-agent state goes on `Session`.

**Work off the UI thread.** Send `Msg::Run(Box::new(move |app| ...))` from
any thread; it runs on the UI thread with `&mut App`. No new `Msg` variant is
needed.

**A part of the screen.** A new file in `ui/` that returns lines or draws
into a `Rect`, and one call in `ui::draw`. Floats are `ui::floats::Float`
(title + lines in highlight groups); pickers and confirm prompts extend it.

**A config section.** An arm in `config::load_str` (and a struct field).
`[ui]` options: a line in `UI_ALIASES` and an arm in `set_option`. Warnings
use the TypeScript wording; gated keys (what runs programs) go in `gated`.
`config::is_trusted` is a stub returning false (Config area: sha256 in
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/vigent/trusted.json`, as `src/trust.ts`).

**A subcommand.** A `Sub` in `cli::SUBCOMMANDS`. **A start flag.** A field in
`StartOptions` and a row in `START_FLAGS`; `cli::main` warns about flags no
area consumes yet (remove your flag from that list when you wire it).

## Differences to know about

- Review: `:dash` marks waiting agents (and failed ones you aren't on) as new,
  for TypeScript's `unread` set. `:race` is the Sessions area's (`race.rs`,
  through `App::start_agent` with each racer's engine and model); its window is
  Review's `TextFloat` (j/k, Enter opens a racer). Hooks have one runner,
  `agents::run_hook` (`App::agents.hook_runner` in tests): worktree_created and
  agent_finished run from agents.rs, before_merge from `review/hooks.rs`. The y/n
  question is Windows' `actions::windows::ask` (`App::ask` wraps it); Review's float (`review/float.rs`) is its
  own, and Windows can fold it into `ui/floats.rs`. Tab completion after `:race
  --engines/--models` isn't ported (Windows' completer). The Review area's tests
  in `test/` (review, hunks, race, counts, usage, and project-config's hook
  tests) import `dist/`; their cases are mirrored as Rust unit tests under
  `review/` (counts are the Windows area's).
- Windows area: `:set`, the `:map` / `:unmap` family, `:command`,
  `:delcommand`, your own commands and `:!` live in `commands/windows.rs`
  (the checklist used to give them to Config; `:hi`, `:let`, `:settings`,
  `:trust` stay Config's). Pickers are `ui::picker::Picker`, opened with
  `actions::windows::open_picker`; y/n questions are `actions::windows::ask`;
  floats with rows to pick are `Float::rich` with `selectable` + `on_select`.
- Every screen row is built as `ui::text::Seg`s exactly the screen's width
  (like the TypeScript's strings) and drawn as one paragraph; a `Seg` with a
  `link` becomes a terminal hyperlink (`ui::write_links`, after the frame).
- `App::input` / `App::cmd` stay plain strings; their cursors are
  `App::windows.input_cursor` / `cmd_cursor`, which go to the end whenever
  the text changes behind them (as setting a LineBuffer's text does).
- `:set termguicolors` / `transparent` change the option but not the colors on
  screen until the theme is loaded again (Config: theme loading).
- Config area: `:set` is `looks::exec_set` (Windows' `apply_set` isn't
  registered); `:map`/`:unmap`/`:command`/`:delcommand`/`:!`/your commands are
  Windows'; `:templates` is Sessions' with Config's picker (`templates.rs`);
  `--demo` is Serve's (Config's `demo.rs` went: one demo). Config's `layout.rs`
  (statusline/winbar) and `usercmd.rs` went too: the screen and your
  commands are Windows'. The theme picker filters with "the letters in order" rather than
  pi-tui's fuzzy score. `:hi Group` shows the attributes but not the colored
  `xxx` sample. Pickers: Windows' `ui::picker`, Engines' `engines::picker`,
  Config's theme and template pickers (`app.cfg`); one shared picker is
  still to do.
- One implementation each where areas overlapped: `:dash` / `:dashboard` and
  `:ls` / `:buffers` / `:files` open Review's list (`review::views::open_dashboard`);
  `<C-^>` / `:b #` read `App::agents.alt` (Sessions); a split's fork is
  `App::fork_session` + `add_session` (`windows::fork_session` adds the tool
  output); `:kill` closes the windows showing the agent (`actions::windows::dropped`);
  focus reporting is `App::focus_changed`. Two pickers remain: Windows'
  `ui::picker` and Engines' `engines::picker` (`:model`/`:effort`/`:engine`);
  folding the second into the first is left to those areas.
- `:theme` with no name shows the theme name; TypeScript opens the picker.
- `:help` may still have milestone-1 wording (Config area); `:checkhealth`'s
  engines part, the sidebar's and the start screen's engines use the TypeScript text.
- When the terminal hangs up, crossterm reads EOF in a loop; tui.rs now exits
  1.5 s after SIGHUP/SIGTERM/SIGINT if the loop hasn't, and stops vigent's
  process group (its agents) when it leads one. Before, a killed pty left vigent
  spinning, with its pi still running.
- Sessions area, what other areas hook into:
  - Windows: a split on the same agent calls `app.fork_session(slot)` (an
    `Err` is the message to show) and adds the fork with `app.add_session`
    (`windows::fork_session`). `App::on_screen(slot)` is the focused agent
    only; make it count every window of a split (notifications and races read it). The queue list,
    `:worktrees` and `:templates` are plain floats until pickers exist (Enter
    doesn't open/start one yet); the race list is Review's selectable float. `ask()` is
    Windows' question on the command line.
  - Engines: `:model`/`:effort` save to the agent's record through
    `engines::select::persist`, which is `App::persist`, so a restart keeps
    them. pi agents reopen on pi (`engines/pi.rs` resumes from
    `records::agent_state_dir`/sessions); without pi on PATH they move to the
    engine new agents use (`movedOffPi`, `App::new_agent_engine()`), else say
    `error: pi isn't installed` and the hint. `select::startup` runs before
    `App::restore`, so `--engine` and config's `engine` decide where they move.
    `:tree` rows come from `tree::flatten`; the pi session doesn't hand it
    pi's tree yet.
  - Review: `:dash`/`:cost`/`:usage` read `Session::tokens`/`cost` (restored
    from the record; `cost` is `None` until the engine prices a run) and
    `session::total_usage`/`format_usage`.
- Serve area:
  - The page's agent ids are slot + 1 (TypeScript's start at 1 and count up the
    same way); an agent's `version` is bumped when what the page shows of it
    changes (a fingerprint the server compares), not on every emit.
  - The event stream is polled: the agent list is built on the UI thread every
    120 ms while a phone follows and sent when it changed (TypeScript coalesces
    `onChange` the same 120 ms). Responses close their connection.
  - A tool's output on the page: `Session::tool_output` (Windows) keeps it now; the page still sends "".
  - `:serve 99999` says node's port error; other bind errors are the OS's wording.
  - Demo agents run on engine "pi" (DemoSession's default), so they show their model.
  - Hooks into shared files: `App::send` and `App::start_agent` hand demo agents
    to serve/demo.rs; `tui::run` starts demo mode instead of restoring agents
    and runs `--serve`; the statusline draws ` DEMO ` and ⇄ through
    `serve::statusline_right`; `Theme::group` and `Theme::normal_bg` (a
    transparent theme's background) give the page its palette;
    `Session::streaming_at` marks a streaming reply.
- Kill keeps the slot (`Session::closed`): `App::open()` is the list the
  TypeScript's `sessions` array is; forks name their original by slot (`fork_of`).
- An agent that finishes goes idle, and unread (◆) when you weren't looking,
  as in TypeScript; `waiting` is for "needs you" (a refused tool to allow, a pi
  dialog). A prompt sent while a CLI is still wrapping up (after Claude Code's
  turn end, before it exits) starts once it exits.

## Pty tests and where they stand

Through the Rust binary, these pass today: all of `standalone`,
`worktree-background`, `reopen-without-pi` 1, 3 and 4, and the non-binary
parts of the others. These fail and are the areas' targets:

| Test | Area |
|---|---|
| e2e 2: first run ... follows up, and comes back after a restart | Sessions (Restore), Engines |
| e2e 3: @ in a prompt: pick a file | passes |
| e2e 5: no agent CLI and no API key: the demo starts | Serve (demo) |
| fork 5: a split forks once | Sessions/Engines: the split and `fork_session` are in; the Claude parser's `Ev::Message` (fork point) and the agent record are missing |
| layout 6: sidebar on the right and a statusline of your own | Serve (`--demo`: the parts show only with an agent; Windows has the layout) |
| permissions-panel 4: two vigents open at once | Engines |
| pi-live 1: vigent --engine pi | Engines |
| project-config 12: untrusted .vigent.toml, :trust, vigent trust | Config (done) |
| reopen-without-pi 1-4 | Sessions (Restore), Engines |
| user-commands 5: a [commands] shell command from config.toml | passes (Windows) |
| worktree-background 2: keys while a worktree is made, the prompt waits | Sessions |

## Parity checklist

`[x]` Rust has it · `[~]` partly · `[ ]` not yet. Area in **bold**.

### CLI (`src/cli.ts`)

- [x] `vigent --version` / `-v` / `version` (no stale-build warning: a binary has no clone) — **Config**

- [x] `--engine <id>` (every built-in engine and yours; unknown exits 1 as in TypeScript) — **Engines**
- [x] `--model <id>` (pi's, or the `--engine` CLI's) — **Engines**
- [x] `--demo` (and the automatic demo when nothing can run agents: no engine chosen, no pi with a key, no Claude Code/Codex/OpenCode or engine of your own on PATH) — **Serve**
- [x] `--serve [--local]` — **Serve**
- [x] `vigent theme list` (built-ins marked, installed themes in `~/.config/vigent/themes` too) — **Config**

- [x] `vigent worktree list` (`worktrees`, `wt`; backend names, detached worktrees) — **Sessions**
- [x] `vigent worktree remove|rm <branch> [--force]` (finds by branch, folder, path or agent name; deletes a merged branch) — **Sessions**
- [x] `vigent worktree prune` — **Sessions**
- [x] `vigent worktree gc` — **Sessions**
- [x] `vigent config init` (writes `CONFIG_TEMPLATE`, `config_template.toml`) — **Config**

### Config (`config.toml`, `.vigent.toml`)

Parsing every section with TypeScript's warnings is done (`config.rs`); `[x]`
below means it's also *used*.
- [x] `theme` / `colorscheme` — **Config**
- [x] `model` (pi's model) — **Engines**
- [x] `engine` (`auto`, a built-in, or a custom one) — **Engines**
- [x] `leader` / `mapleader` — **Config**
- [~] `[ui]` [x] `sidebar`, `sidebar_width`, `sidebar_position`, `number`, `tilde`, `icons`, `whichkey`, `timeoutlen`; [ ] `termguicolors`, `transparent` (the theme is loaded once: Config) — **Windows**; [x] `notify` — **Sessions**
- [x] `[engines.<id>]` `args`, `model`, `effort` — **Engines**; `allow` `[x]`, `ask` `[x]` (always-allow isn't written to config.toml yet) — **Engines**
- [x] `[engines.<id>]` with `command`: `name`, `output`, `model_args`, `models`, `resume_args` — **Engines**
- [x] `[keys]`, `[keys.normal|insert|visual|command]` — **Config**
- [x] `[highlights]` (tables, `:hi` strings, links) — **Config**
- [x] `[worktree]` `enabled`, `dir`, `branch`, `base`, `backend` — **Sessions**
- [x] `[templates.<name>]` `prompt`, `description`, `engine`, `model`, `effort`, `worktree` (+ built-ins fix, test, review, explain) — **Sessions**
- [x] `[hooks]` `worktree_created` (holds the first prompt), `agent_finished` — **Sessions** (`agents::run_hook`); `before_merge` — **Review** (`review/hooks.rs`)
- [x] `[statusline]` / `[winbar]` `left`, `right` — **Windows**
- [x] `[commands]` — **Windows** (parsed by Config)
- [~] `[style]` [x] `sidebar` (tree, compact, cards), `messages` (plain, labeled; bubbles' agent header), `tool_icons`, `user_label`, `[style.icons]`, `[style.nerd_icons]`; [ ] `separators` (powerline statusline and winbar pill), bubbles' prompt box, a theme's own `[style]` — **Windows**
- [x] project `.vigent.toml` layered over yours, gated until trusted (`trust.rs`: sha256 in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vigent/trusted.json`) — **Config**
- [x] theme files in `~/.config/vigent/themes` (`.toml`, `.json`, `.vim`), `extends`, palettes, `[style]` in themes — **Config**

### Engines

- [x] Claude Code (`claude -p --output-format stream-json`), resume, model, effort, thinking, turn end / Stop hook, denials — **Engines**
- [x] Codex (`codex exec --json`, resume, fork args) — **Engines**
- [x] OpenCode — **Engines**
- [x] Gemini CLI — **Engines**
- [x] Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent`) — **Engines**
- [~] pi (`pi --mode rpc`: one per agent, kept running; prompts, events, retries, compaction, extension dialogs via the picker, `:model`/`:effort`, resume from its session file in git's worktree record) (reopened at startup by **Sessions**) — **Engines**; not yet: `:tree` navigation (pi's tree into `tree::flatten`)
- [x] custom engines from `[engines.<id>]` — **Engines**
- [x] detection: installed, version, signed in, install hints, the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY rule (`dropEnv`) — **Engines**
- [x] `defaultEngine` (auto: first signed-in CLI, else pi with a key) — **Engines**
- [x] model and effort choices (`src/choices.ts`) — **Engines**
- [~] Claude Code permission denials: what was refused and the rule that allows it `[x]`; `[engines.claude] ask`: allow once / always (kept for the session; writing config.toml waits for Config's line editor) and retry `[x]`; `:permissions` panel and its file `[ ]` — **Engines**
- [~] fork a conversation (`--fork-session`, `--resume-session-at`): `App::fork_session`, `last_claude_message`, fork runs once then keeps its own id; the split is **Windows**', the Claude `Message` event **Engines**' — **Sessions** with **Engines**

### Sessions, Review, Windows, Serve features beyond commands and keys

- [x] an agent per worktree (riftri, git fallback), made in the background; prompts wait — **Sessions**
- [x] queue while running, drain after the CLI exits — **Sessions**
- [x] an agent that finishes while you look elsewhere is unread (◆) until you open it; `waiting` is "needs you", as in TypeScript — **Sessions**
- [x] agent records saved (made, conversation id, totals and settings at the end of each run) and reopened; usage totals survive a restart — **Sessions**
- [x] `:kill` marks the record detached; `:attach` reopens — **Sessions**
- [x] races (`src/race.ts`): racers start when every worktree is made, the race-over message ranks them, the bell for unseen ones — **Sessions**; the race window — **Review**
- [ ] conversation tree (`src/tree.ts`): pi's, waits for the pi session — **Sessions** with **Engines**
- [x] riftri storage health in `:checkhealth` (`riftriHealth`) and the `:worktrees` footer — **Sessions**
- [x] diff view, hunk review, merge, PR, transcript export, dashboard, usage — **Review**
- [x] splits, sidebar focus, search, VISUAL, folds, marks, jumps, tool output folding, markdown (`src/markdown.ts`, links as OSC 8 printed over the frame), icons (`src/icons.ts`), styles (`src/style.ts`, see `[style]`), pickers (`src/picker.ts` ChoicePicker: `windows::open_picker`; the theme picker with live preview is Config's), confirm prompts (`windows::ask`) — **Windows**
- [x] alternate screen and focus reporting (`EnableFocusChange`, `App::focus_changed`) — **Windows**, **Sessions**
- [x] desktop notification / bell when an agent finishes elsewhere, focus reporting, `[ui] notify` (`src/notify.ts`, in agents.rs) — **Sessions**
- [x] usage float (`:usage`) — **Review**
- [x] `:serve` web page over std's `TcpListener` (`src/serve.ts`, `src/serve-page.ts`): access code, bearer/`?code=` reads, header-only prompts and stops, constant-time compare, 10 wrong codes lock it, the page in the theme's colors, the agent list over SSE, follow-ups, stop, new agents, LAN addresses — **Serve**
- [~] demo sessions (`src/demo.ts`, `DemoSession`): the three scripted agents, streaming, prompts answered, `:new` in demo mode; a tool's output isn't shown (Rust's transcript keeps no tool output yet) — **Serve**
